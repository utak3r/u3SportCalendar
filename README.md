# u3SportCalendar

For now it has just started.

What it will be, is a web scraper, collecting info on selected sport events and adding them to a Google Calendar.

Right now I'm working on a functionality itself, once it will be more or less working, I'll start adding an UI and configuration possibilities.

For starters, I've made a simple initial BetsAPI scraping. Yes, it's scraping, as its API is paid ;) so it's scraping the web page itself. Later on aybe I'll go for Flashscore, but it's a bit harder to so, as it's a JavaScript rendered page.

As of Google Calendar part, I've implemented for now just events reading from a selected calendar, to check if the API is working at all. And yes, it's working :) So next step would be adding collected events to it.
